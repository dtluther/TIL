## Vanilla JS 30
### Drum kit project
* Became familiar with an audio element and learned out to play a sound
* Added vanilla JS event listener to the window and to other elements: `window.addEventListener('keydown', playSound);`.
* Learned about event property types, specifically: `event.propertyName !== transform`.
