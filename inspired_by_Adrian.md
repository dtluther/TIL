# A Public Progress Tracker, Psuedo-Journal, and Thought Container

### Inspired by my former classmate, Adrian.
The main goal of this is to hold myself accountable as I study and prepare for upcoming job interviews and, ultimately, my career as a software engineer. However, from time to time, you may hear a little more than just my progress report

At the bare minimum, I want to commit to this every workday that I am in town. A goal above that would be to commit a little something everyday, and in order to shoot for that goal, if I am unable to write code for that day, I will try to read some tech article and write one sentence about it.

The first entry for this was on Saturday, 1/6, which was about 9 weeks after finishing App Academy.

## 1/6 - Saturday
I doubt my average entry will be of this length, but as this is a sort of new endeavor, this one has a few more lines of information.

I've been trying to find the best platform for me to study data structures and algorithms, but have been having a tough time buckling down and focusing. I've done some in CTCI, tried LeetCode, and today I began CodeFights, which I like a lot so far. Regardless, I need to commit to something and just stick with it. I need to continue to develop the technique and discipline of practicing and struggling through these algorithms. So cheers to at least 2 weeks on CodeFights!
    * As a big Tim Ferriss fan, I like his idea of 2 week projects and 6 month experiments. Here's to trying a 2 week "project" of practicing on CodeFights, and we'll see where it goes!

Additionally, at this point I want to work toward being a frontend engineer, but have not been spending a whole lot of time practicing building frontend projects and components because of my focus on algorithm studying, which is often very necessary to interviews. As I'm trying to find a balance between these two, I have tried to narrow down to as few tasks as possible, so I don't spread myself thin and get nothing done. So in addition to the algorithm studyhing mentioned above, I am also following a tutorial for learning Node.js (it builds out the full frontend of an app as well, at least I think) from Wes Bos. So shame on me if I'm doing anything other than these two things during this 2 week project.
