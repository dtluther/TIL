# A Public Progress Tracker, Psuedo-Journal, and Thought Container

### Inspired by my former classmate, Adrian.
The main goal of this is to hold myself accountable as I study and prepare for upcoming job interviews and, ultimately, my career as a software engineer. However, from time to time, you may hear a little more than just my progress report

At the bare minimum, I want to commit to this every workday that I am in town. A goal above that would be to commit a little something everyday, and in order to shoot for that goal, if I am unable to write code for that day, I will try to read some tech article and write one sentence about it.

The first entry for this was on Saturday, 1/6, which was about 9 weeks after finishing App Academy.

## 2/7 - Wednesday
Accepted job with RE this week. WOOHOO!!!!

## 2/1 - Thursday
First day of February. A good day.

## 1/31 - Wednesday
Prepped for onsite tomorrow by reviewing blocks, procs, and lambdas in Ruby. Tomorrow will review some ActiveRecord lifecycle methods, Rails, and a little bit of SQL.

## 1/30 - Tuesday
Spent quite a bit of time customizing terminal today with oh-my-zsh and powershell theme specifically. Also chatted with a friend about a big company referral, so going to prepare for that over the next 2 weeks. Additionally, got a call for an onsite Thursday. Going to refresh on some RoR knowledge, and general Ruby.

## 1/29 - Monday
Spent my day finishing the coding challenge from Blend (for myself, as they already said they would not be moving forward with me). It was an awesome experience. I learned some CSS tricks, made the page responsive (at a very basic level), and ended up hosting it so now I have a nice clean project to add to my site.

## 1/28 - Sunday
Wasn't able to finish the coding challenge completely, and spent majority of the time I had on it. Made me realize there was a lot of stuff about Rails, React, Redux that I don't fully understand, so I made some notes. I'm looking into going back through some of our curriculum and final projects for understanding.

## 1/27 - Saturday
Begain frontend coding challenge for company at around 6. They estimate 2-4 hours to do it, but I have get a full day on the test. Looks like it may take a while.

## 1/26 - Friday
More applications, did some HackerRank prep in JS to prepare for the coding challenge which I will begin tomorrow evening.

## 1/25 - Thursday
Behavioral phone call with company, received coding challenge. Have 24 hours due Sunday. Also worked on 2 linked list problems. Got one correctly, then solved another with suboptimal time complexity and space complexity, so reviewing it.

## 1/24 - Wednesday
Scheduled behavior call with another company, did some practice with linked lists on CodeFights, but I think I want to review their structure more as some of the problems don't seem to be making sense.

## 1/23 - Tuesday
Rejected by Thorn, asked for feedback, won't provide any due to volume. Also got rejected by Level, but I did terrible in that interview. Read a really great blog post on Medium by a HR grad on ho wto get a job after a bootcamp: https://medium.freecodecamp.org/5-key-learnings-from-the-post-bootcamp-job-search-9a07468d2331.

## 1/22 - Monday
"Do something today that your future self would be proud of." A quote Tim Ferriss reposted on Instagram. Today, signed up for interviewing.io (in Beta right now), and it gives a discount for InterviewCake. May take a look at one of these to practice techinical interviews.

## 1/18 - Thursday
Finished coding challenge from Thorn. Had informal phone screen with RE, and informal (slightly technical) phone screen with Level, and just embarrassed myself with my lack of answers to simples frontend questions. Here's to taking that embarrassment and learning about all of the different frontend concepts for CSS, JS, HTML, cross-browser compatibility, and responsiveness.

## 1/17 - Wednesday
Worked on coding challenge from Thorn.

## 1/16 - Tuesday
Recovered from jetlag, cleaned emails, and scheduled interviews. Scheduled time to study algorithms in the mornings with Trevor beginning end of this week.

## 1/15 - Monday
Back from Budafest 2018. AMAZING. Read Nathan Kontny's article about deliberate practice, which I want to come back to occasionally: https://m.signalvnoise.com/deliberate-practice-5eebebb72e4f. Repetition, Imitation, Experimentation, Contraints. Thse are things I can use for deliberate practice to improve my skills in anything, even science or arts.

## 1/10 - Wednesday
Prepped to leave for Budafest, so read a Medium article today: https://medium.freecodecamp.org/how-i-re-built-the-medium-clap-effect-and-what-i-got-out-of-the-experiment-991672995fdf. "Good artists copy; great artists steal." - Pablo Picasso. This was the quote that semi-inspired the author to go ahead and try to recreate someone else's idea by hand, and he learned a lot from it. Eventually, he put it on CodePen and the pen was selected and it got viewed by 2000+ people, and he got to give a talk at the ReactJS Summit, Lagos.

So it's good to find projects and recreate them for learning, even if it's typing out someone else's code line-by-line (just give them credit and don't actually *steal* their code :) ).

## 1/9 - Tuesday
Apps today. Got a response from a front end position, so debating doing a quick project for some review.

## 1/8 - Monday
Finished arrays section on CodeFights interview prep, and got the last one with no help at all. Started on linked lists, but got stuck. Looking forward to tackling them tomorrow.

## 1/7 - Sunday
The goal was two problems on CodeFights, and work on some more of the LearnNode project. I redid a problem and understood it extremely well, and am working on finsihing up another. Most likely won't work on Node tonight. Overall, rather unproductive Sunday with coding, although I took care of several external chores. Also started reading What's Best Next, and will finish the intro today.

I need to figure out the best way help myself remove distraction and allow myself to focus AND enjoy learning more of these algorithms.

## 1/6 - Saturday
I doubt my average entry will be of this length, but as this is a sort of new endeavor, this one has a few more lines of information.

I've been trying to find the best platform for me to study data structures and algorithms, but have been having a tough time buckling down and focusing. I've done some in CTCI, tried LeetCode, and today I began CodeFights, which I like a lot so far. Regardless, I need to commit to something and just stick with it. I need to continue to develop the technique and discipline of practicing and struggling through these algorithms. So cheers to at least 2 weeks on CodeFights!
    * As a big Tim Ferriss fan, I like his idea of 2 week projects and 6 month experiments. Here's to trying a 2 week "project" of practicing on CodeFights, and we'll see where it goes!

Additionally, at this point I want to work toward being a frontend engineer, but have not been spending a whole lot of time practicing building frontend projects and components because of my focus on algorithm studying, which is often very necessary to interviews. As I'm trying to find a balance between these two, I have tried to narrow down to as few tasks as possible, so I don't spread myself thin and get nothing done. So in addition to the algorithm studyhing mentioned above, I am also following a tutorial for learning Node.js (it builds out the full frontend of an app as well, at least I think) from Wes Bos. So shame on me if I'm doing anything other than these two things during this 2 week project. Well, when I finish the Node course, I will allow myself other projects in JS 30.
