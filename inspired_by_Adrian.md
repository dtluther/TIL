# A Public Progress Tracker, Psuedo-Journal, and Thought Container

#### Inspired by my former classmate, Adrian
The main goal of this is to hold myself accountable as I study and prepare for upcoming job interviews and, ultimately, my career as a software engineer. However, from time to time, you may hear a little more than just my progress report

At the bare minimum, I want to commit to this every workday that I am in town. A goal above that would be to commit a little something everyday, and in order to shoot for that goal, if I am unable to write code for that day, I will try to read some tech article and write one sentence about it.

### 1/6 - Saturday
I've been trying to find the best platform for me to study data structures and algorithms, but have been having a tough time buckling down and focusing. I've done some in CTCI, tried LeetCode, and today I began CodeFights, which I like a lot so far. Regardless, I need to commit to something and just stick with it. I need to continue to develop the technique and discipline of practicing and struggling through these algorithms. So cheers to at least 2 weeks on CodeFights!
    * As a big Tim Ferriss fan, I like his idea of 2 week projects and 6 month experiments. Here's to trying a 2 week "project" of practicing on CodeFights, and we'll see where it goes!
