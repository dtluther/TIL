# A Public Progress Tracker, Psuedo-Journal, and Thought Container

### Inspired by my former classmate, Adrian.
The main goal of this is to hold myself accountable as I study and prepare for upcoming job interviews and, ultimately, my career as a software engineer. However, from time to time, you may hear a little more than just my progress report

At the bare minimum, I want to commit to this every workday that I am in town. A goal above that would be to commit a little something everyday, and in order to shoot for that goal, if I am unable to write code for that day, I will try to read some tech article and write one sentence about it.

The first entry for this was on Saturday, 1/6, which was about 9 weeks after finishing App Academy.

## 1/15 - Monday
Back from Budafest 2018. AMAZING. Read Nathan Kontny's article about deliberate practice, which I want to come back to occasionally: https://m.signalvnoise.com/deliberate-practice-5eebebb72e4f. Repetition, Imitation, Experimentation, Contraints. Thse are things I can use for deliberate practice to improve my skills in anything, even science or arts.

## 1/10 - Wednesday
Prepped to leave for Budafest, so read a Medium article today: https://medium.freecodecamp.org/how-i-re-built-the-medium-clap-effect-and-what-i-got-out-of-the-experiment-991672995fdf. "Good artists copy; great artists steal." - Pablo Picasso. This was the quote that semi-inspired the author to go ahead and try to recreate someone else's idea by hand, and he learned a lot from it. Eventually, he put it on CodePen and the pen was selected and it got viewed by 2000+ people, and he got to give a talk at the ReactJS Summit, Lagos.

So it's good to find projects and recreate them for learning, even if it's typing out someone else's code line-by-line (just give them credit and don't actually *steal* their code :) ).

## 1/9 - Tuesday
Apps today. Got a response from a front end position, so debating doing a quick project for some review.

## 1/8 - Monday
Finished arrays section on CodeFights interview prep, and got the last one with no help at all. Started on linked lists, but got stuck. Looking forward to tackling them tomorrow.

## 1/7 - Sunday
The goal was two problems on CodeFights, and work on some more of the LearnNode project. I redid a problem and understood it extremely well, and am working on finsihing up another. Most likely won't work on Node tonight. Overall, rather unproductive Sunday with coding, although I took care of several external chores. Also started reading What's Best Next, and will finish the intro today.

I need to figure out the best way help myself remove distraction and allow myself to focus AND enjoy learning more of these algorithms.

## 1/6 - Saturday
I doubt my average entry will be of this length, but as this is a sort of new endeavor, this one has a few more lines of information.

I've been trying to find the best platform for me to study data structures and algorithms, but have been having a tough time buckling down and focusing. I've done some in CTCI, tried LeetCode, and today I began CodeFights, which I like a lot so far. Regardless, I need to commit to something and just stick with it. I need to continue to develop the technique and discipline of practicing and struggling through these algorithms. So cheers to at least 2 weeks on CodeFights!
    * As a big Tim Ferriss fan, I like his idea of 2 week projects and 6 month experiments. Here's to trying a 2 week "project" of practicing on CodeFights, and we'll see where it goes!

Additionally, at this point I want to work toward being a frontend engineer, but have not been spending a whole lot of time practicing building frontend projects and components because of my focus on algorithm studying, which is often very necessary to interviews. As I'm trying to find a balance between these two, I have tried to narrow down to as few tasks as possible, so I don't spread myself thin and get nothing done. So in addition to the algorithm studyhing mentioned above, I am also following a tutorial for learning Node.js (it builds out the full frontend of an app as well, at least I think) from Wes Bos. So shame on me if I'm doing anything other than these two things during this 2 week project. Well, when I finish the Node course, I will allow myself other projects in JS 30.
