# About Django
#### Django's Model-Template-View pattern mirrors mirrors the Model-View-Controller paradigm I'm familiar with
* Django is uses a view and templating system, which function similarly to controllers and views respectively in MVC

#### Serializers are used when we connect to another frameworke, like React, because we need to convert the model instances to JSON so the frontend can easily work with the data.
